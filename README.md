# multislice

Create a class to store a grid of delta and beta values (of the x-ray refractive index) and carry out multislice propogation.

Output the final wavefront and wavefront at intermediate stages if specifed.

Output shown is performed on the grid taken from https://github.com/mdw771/xdesign/blob/master/tests/test_tube_particles.py
